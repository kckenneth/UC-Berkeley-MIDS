We explored how different data structures and design patterns can help us manage the computational complexity of an algorithm. As part of this process you implemented both a supervised learning alogorithm (Naive Bayes) and an unsupervised learning algorithm (synonym detection via cosine similarity). In both of these tasks parallelization helped us manage calculations involving a large number of features. However a large feature space isn't the only situation that might prompt us to want to parallelize a machine learning algorithm. In the final two assignments we'll look at cases where the iterative nature of an algorithm is the main driver of its computational complexity (and the reason we might want to parallelize it).\n", "\n", "In this week's assignment we'll perform 3 kinds of linear regression: OLS, Ridge and Lasso.
