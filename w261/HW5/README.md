# Homework 5: Distributed Graph Processing 

In this homework you will implement Page Rank on data from a subset of the Wikipedia hyperlink graph. While the bulk of this assignment (including doing EDA and developing the algorithm on your toy datasets) can be done locally. The final spark job in question 8 is computationally heavy and you will want to run it on a cluster. To facillitate this we are providing Google Cloud credits. Follow the instructions in ./GCP/create_account.md and ./GCP/setup.md to set up your account and create a cluster. We will release an addendum next week with addtional support for running Q8 using this setup.
